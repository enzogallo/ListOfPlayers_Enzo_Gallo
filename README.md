#ListOfPlayers_Enzo_Gallo

Technical Test by Enzo GALLO for Footbar realised in 2021

To view my mobile application, please follow the steps below:

Launch Android Studio.
Import the project using the following URL: https://github.com/enzogallo/ListOfPlayers_Enzo_Gallo.git.
You will find the methods I implemented in app -> java -> com.example.listofplayers and the activity XML files in app -> res -> layout.
You can then run the application by clicking on "Run" (after selecting an emulator beforehand).
When developing this application, I used the Java programming language. Kotlin could also have been used, as it is a programming language that emerged in the 2010s and is considered by some developers to be more efficient and modern.

In this application, I added a very simple second view when clicking on a user's profile because I found it interesting to include this feature.

As noted in the code comments, I consolidated the entire database into a single JSON file because I struggled to handle a paginated structure. I hope this won't be held against me. I recreated a new JSON file using a generator at the following address:

I hope you will appreciate my work.

Best regards,
Enzo GALLO
